# ProjectLISA (Senior Design Project)

## Description

Technology has brought numerous positive changes that have transformed the way people live and work today. We can no longer imagine a world without it.
However, as humans **embrace the benefits** of this technological age, we also **contribute to climate change with our digital carbon footprint**. Every online activity, as simple as streaming videos, consumes some amount of energy and **increases carbon emissions**. This poses a significant **threat** to the environment and human health.

We decided to create a web application designed to encourage Lenovo users to live sustainability. With our product, we aim to provide an efficient way for users interested in a **sustainable lifestyle** to **keep track of their digital carbon footprint**. We target the general public, focusing on those interested in sustainable technology.

## Our Mission

- Reduce users' digital carbon footprint & promote a sustainable lifestyle
- Inspire positive social and environmental impact
- Encourage 'sticky' consumer behavior

## Key Features

- Users can sign up, register their devices, and work towards goals, allowing them to make environmentally conscious choices.
- Points are earned based on goal completion and can be used to redeem rewards!
- Users can compare their points to others on the leaderboard.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Handlebars, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
